# XGBoost Model

I've recently been playing around with machine learning algorithms, and this is a recent project of mine where I implemented XGBoost to predict housing prices from various housing features. This project was inspired from projects on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

The jupyter notebook may be found by clicking on the file "XGBoost Model.ipynb" or by clicking [here](https://github.com/alanhahn07/XGBoost_Model/blob/main/XGBoost%20Model.ipynb).

The data used for the model is found in the folder titled "home_data".
